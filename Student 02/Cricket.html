    <h2>About Cricket</h2>
    <p>The behavior you are experiencing when pressing Shift + 3 on your HP Windows 11 laptop is due to a difference in keyboard layouts between regions. On some keyboard layouts, the pound sterling symbol (£) is generated when pressing Shift + 3, whereas on other layouts, the hash symbol (#) is produced.

        To fix this issue and get the hash symbol to display when pressing Shift + 3, you can change the keyboard layout to one that matches your region. Here's how you can do it:
        
        Click on the "Start" button in the bottom-left corner of the taskbar.
        
        Click on the "Settings" (gear icon) to open the Windows Settings.
        
        In the Windows Settings window, click on "Time & Language."
        
        In the left sidebar, click on "Language."
        
        In the "Preferred languages" section, you'll see the language(s) and keyboard layout(s) that are currently installed on your system. If your desired keyboard layout is not listed, you can add it by clicking on "Add a language."
        
        Search for and select your desired language and keyboard layout. For example, "English (United States) - US."
        
        Once you've added the desired keyboard layout, click on it, and then click on "Options."
        
        Under "Input method," click on "Add an input method."
        
        Choose the appropriate keyboard layout. For example, select "US QWERTY" or "United States - International."
        
        Remove any unwanted keyboard layouts from the "Preferred languages" section by clicking on them and selecting "Remove."
        
        Make sure your desired keyboard layout is set as the default by clicking on it and selecting "Move up" until it is at the top of the list.
        
        Close the Settings window.
        
        Now, when you press Shift + 3, it should display the hash symbol (#) instead of the pound sterling symbol (£) based on the selected keyboard layout.
        
        Keep in mind that the steps may vary slightly depending on the specific version of Windows 11 you are using, but the general process should be similar.
