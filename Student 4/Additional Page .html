            <p>Football is the most popular ball game in the 
                world in terms of fans as well as players. The sport, which has simple rules and
                 equipment, may be played practically anyplace, from official football playing fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets,
                  school playgrounds, parks, or beaches. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), football's governing body, estimated that at 
                  the turn of the 21st century, there were roughly 250 million players in the sport and over 1.3 billion people "interested" in football; in 2010, a 
                  combined television audience  of more than 26 billion watched football's premier tournament, the quadrennial month-long World Cup finals.</p>
